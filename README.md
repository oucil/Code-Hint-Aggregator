Code-Hint-Aggregator
====================

A utility for parsing a PHP application and compiling a list of all Class Methods and their corresponding code hints, but stripping out all code guts and other documentation.  The purpose is to create a PHP like function mapping similar to the one utilized in Eclipse (standard.php).
